- Fido's Trick Log is a web application that caters to dog owners who are looking to take their pups skills to the next level. The app features a 'Trick Log' where the user can compile their favorite training videos in one place. 

## Contributors

- [Eric Batiste](https://github.com/ericbatiste)

## Features

- The user can access a list of dog training tutorials from YouTube, along with a trick name and difficulty level.
- The user can add new tutorials to the trick log through a form.
- The user can filter / search for the tutorials by name while on the Trick Log page.

## Live Link

[Click here](https://dog-tricks-ui.vercel.app/) to visit the application.
- If the app isn't working right away just give the API half a minute to spin up.

### Challenges

- Deploying both a frontend and backend application and making everything run smoothly.
- My personal timeline for completing this project was about 2.5 days, so I needed to hustle.

### Installation

Clone the repository:

`git clone git@github.com:ericbatiste/dog-tricks-ui.git`

### Navigate to the project directory:

`cd dog-tricks-ui`

### Install dependencies:

`npm install`

### Usage

Start the development server:

`npm start`

Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to access the application.

#### Future Improvements

Some ideas for new features and improvements to the site going forward:

- Give the user the ability to remove tricks from the Trick Log and add a delete request to the API.
- Give the user a space to add notes on their dog's progress with each trick.
- Add links to the most recent tricks on the home page for quick access.
- Add User Authentication for a personalized experience.
- Hook the site up to a proper database to support multiple users.
